In this project, we aim to enhance the predictive performance of a Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR, https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) model for genomic predictions using the EasyGeSe (https://github.com/stevenandrewyates/EasyGeSe) database. EasyGeSe is a comprehensive genomic dataset that provides valuable insights into genetic variations and their associations with various phenotypic traits (Quesada _et al_., 2024).
